[See source code for this example](examples/Laminar.Avalonia.SelectAndMove.Example/MainWindow.axaml)

## Implementation Details
The core SelectAndMove class is a Canvas with several GestureRecognisers that manage the select, pan, zoom, move, and box select gestures. These are designed to be portable and can go on any other Panel - making a new Canvas and adding these GestureRecognizers gives identical functionality to the SelectAndMove class. This also allows for extended functionality by adding additional GestureRecognizers.

Also provided is a BackgroundGridLines class which is designed to be added as a child to the SelectAndMove canvas. It adds grid lines that automatically adjusts to the current zoom level, and provides a "SnapGrid" property that can be bound to the SelectAndMove canvas to snap controls to the grid lines (shown in the [example](examples/Laminar.Avalonia.SelectAndMove.Example/MainWindow.axaml))

Thanks to the [PanAndZoom](https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/PanAndZoom) for name and code inspiration. If all you need is the Pan and Zoom functionality, PanAndZoom may be easier to use.
